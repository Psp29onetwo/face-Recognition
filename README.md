    - From the saves Dataset this system gets trained and saves the trained dataset in YML file tooğŸ—„ğŸ—„ğŸ—„.
    - Can handle many faces with their names at once ğŸ˜€ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜¶ğŸ˜‘ğŸ˜¯ğŸ˜¯.
    - Furthur more features is that it can detect the nose and mouth of multiple faces at a time too.

-   Change img_id to 2 for second user generate_data.py.
-   repeate 2nd, 3rd, 4th step to generate as many users.
-   Run classifier.py to train and generate classifier.yml file which contains the trained data.
-   Run script.py and play around the face detections of all users which are trained.
