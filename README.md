    - Detect multiple faces at a timeâŒšâŒšâŒš.
    - Capture the faces and saves the faces only as a dataset.
    - From the saves Dataset this system gets trained and saves the trained dataset in YML file tooğŸ—„ğŸ—„ğŸ—„.
    - Can handle many faces with their names at once ğŸ˜€ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜¶ğŸ˜‘ğŸ˜¯ğŸ˜¯.
    - Furthur more features is that it can detect the nose and mouth of multiple faces at a time too.

4.   Change img_id to 2 for second user generate_data.py.
5.   Repeate 2nd, 3rd, 4th step to generate as many users.
6.   Run classifier.py to train and generate classifier.yml file which contains the trained data.
7.   Run script.py and play around the face detections of all users which are trained.
